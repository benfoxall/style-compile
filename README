Warning - this has been cobbled together in a couple of hours,  use with caution and make sure your files are on VCS

Style compile lets you use modern css generators with existing stylesheets

In an existing css file (style.css) - include a comment like :

/* @style-compile madstyles.less */

then run :

	style-compile style.css

This will make a file called madstyle.less,  where you can put your new super awesome lesscss.

when you change your .less file - your css will change to

/* @style-compile madstyles.less */
/*---begin:madstyles.less---*/
... your compiled css here ...
/*---end:madstyles.less---*/
